## 1. Information We Collect

StackInsight.dev is a static website that does not require user logins, accounts, or interactive features. We do not use cookies, localStorage, or similar technologies to collect personal information. However, we may collect:

- **Usage Data (Non-Personal):** We use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics or Plausible) to collect anonymized data about how visitors interact with our site. This may include:
  - Pages visited
  - Time spent on the site
  - Referral sources (e.g., search engines or social media)
  - Device type, browser, and general location (e.g., country-level data derived from IP addresses)

This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.

  - Your name
  - Email address
  - Any other information you choose to provide

## 3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

StackInsight.dev does not use cookies, localStorage, or any tracking technologies that store data on your device. Our analytics tools may use anonymized identifiers (e.g., hashed IP addresses) to track usage patterns, but these do not contain personally identifiable information.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services to support our website, such as:

- **Analytics Providers:** Tools like Google Analytics or Plausible to understand site usage. These services may collect anonymized data as described above. Please review their privacy policies for details:

Any third-party services we use are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.

## 6. Data Security

As a static website, StackInsight.dev minimizes data collection and storage.
